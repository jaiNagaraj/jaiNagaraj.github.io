I am a second-year undergraduate Turing Scholar studying Computer Science in the College of Natural Sciences. My interests include reinforcement learning, optimization, and game theory, as well as their applications to robotics. I do research in these fields as a [member](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/people/Jai_Nagaraj/index.html) of the Control and Learning for Autonomous Robotics (CLeAR) Lab at the Oden Institute.

Outside of research, I am the vice president of the Freetail Hackers club, which hosts large hackathon events at the university including HackTX, one of the biggest hackathons in the nation. In my free time, you may find me complaining about my favorite college and professional football teams in the fall and winter. Otherwise, I love watching anime, playing JRPGs, and making music.
